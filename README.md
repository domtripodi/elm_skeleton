# Elm Skeleton 
No extra set-up, just includes a basic Main.elm in simple file structure.

## To Make Life Easier
Run the following script in your terminal. There is no funny business here - feel free to copy the script link and check it out yourself. 

All it does is clone the repository, remove the unecessary local .git folder and download the npm package "elm-live" to allow live reloading. 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domtripodi/elm-new-script/master/elm-basic.sh)
```

## Alternatively
You can just pull this repo, remove and install whatever you like!
