# Elm Skeleton 
No extra set-up, just includes a basic Main.elm in simple file structure.

## To Make Life Easier
Run the following script in your terminal. There is not funny business here - feel free to copy the script link and check it out. 

All it does is clone the repository, removes the unecessary local .git folder and downloads the npm package "elm-live" to allow live reloading. 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domtripodi/elm-new-script/master/elm-basic.sh)
```

## Alternatively
You can either just pull this repo, remove and install whatever you like!
